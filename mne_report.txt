MNE Report
--------------------

Patient ID: 12345
Date: 2025-02-07
Technician: Dr. Jane Doe

Summary:
The patient underwent a Magnetoencephalography (MNE) study to assess brain activity. The following findings were observed:

1. **Resting State Analysis:**
   - Alpha rhythm predominates in the occipital region.
   - Beta activity observed in the frontal lobes.

2. **Event-Related Potentials (ERPs):**
   - P300 component detected at 300 ms post-stimulus.
   - N200 component observed in response to target stimuli.

3. **Source Localization:**
   - Increased activity in the left temporal lobe during auditory processing tasks.

Recommendations:
- Further evaluation with EEG may be beneficial.
- Consider follow-up imaging studies to assess structural abnormalities.

Conclusion:
Overall, the MNE study indicates normal brain activity with specific regional increases associated with cognitive tasks. Further investigation is recommended.
